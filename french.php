<p>At the Pre-school level, basic French words and language structures are taught 
through songs, action games, and activities both oral and written. Children focus on 
themes such as the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>food</li>
	<li>animals</li>
	<li>colours</li>
	<li>family holiday celebrations</li>
</ul>

<p>Children are 
encouraged to speak in French. They are also encouraged to participate as much as
 possible to gain 
confidence and achieve success.</p>
