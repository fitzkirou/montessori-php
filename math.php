<P>At the Guelph Montessori School, the child builds an understanding of
numbers using concrete materials:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><img src="images/06math1.jpg" width="341" height="256" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="right">Number Rods</LI>
  <LI>Beads</LI>
  <LI>Cubes</LI>
  <LI>Number Cards</LI>
</UL>

<P>The children combine, separate, share, count, and compare these concrete
materials. Building on this foundation, we guide each child to more abstract
mathematical constructions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Tables</LI>

<LI>Charts</LI>

<LI>Arithmetic games</LI>
</UL>

<P>All of the math exercises help the child to an internal grasp of basic
mathematical concepts and processes. At this age the children have an extreme
sense of order; all of them find mathematics simple, enjoyable, and satisfying.<FONT SIZE=+1>
