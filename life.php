  <LI>setting the dinner table</LI>
  <LI>fastening clothes</LI>
  <LI>washing hands</LI>
  <LI>using scissors</LI>
  <LI>washing linen</LI>
</UL>

<P>These exercises offer the child the means of caring for himself and
his environment. As well, they build confidence in the young child and
allow his independent nature to flourish.</P>

<P>Guelph Montessori teachers encourage the children to form gracious and
courteous habits--and to be respectful of others and of their environment.
These activities provide the base on which the children approach more intricate
academic exercises. </P>
