<p>Through presentations of dialogues, projects, and short stories, the Elementary 
program accomplishes four key aims:</p>

<ul>
	<li>to introduce the students to French grammar</li>
	<li>to elaborate on language structures</li>
	<li>to increase students' vocabulary</li>
	<li>to improve their oral expression</li>
</ul>

<p>Students are 
encouraged to speak in French as much as possible and to participate fully in all 
activities both oral and written.</p>
