<p>The rich language development that begins in the primary classrooms is used as the 
foundation of the elementary language curriculum.</p>

	<p>The elementary child enters the classroom as a reader and a writer.  
The curriculum works to expand these abilities by raising the child's awareness of the 
rules, patterns and functions of language.  This is accomplished by a thorough study of 
the following topics:

  <li><img src="images/06elemlanguage.jpg" width="341" height="256" hspace="20" vspace="5" align="right">grammar</li>
  <li>sentence analysis</li>
  <li>word studies (prefixes, suffixes, thesaurus, dictionary, etc.)</li>
  <li>reading</li>
  <li>writing</li>
</ul>

	<p>Each child is exposed to a variety of literature and poetry.  The study of literature 
allows the child to discover the elements of style and how it may be incorporated into their own writing.  
	The language curriculum allows the child to "unlock" the mysteries of the English 
language and to develop a natural interest in reading and writing.</p>
