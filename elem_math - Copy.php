<p>The mathematics curriculum allows the child to explore and discover new 
concepts through a "hands on" approach.  Each concept is presented with materials 
that allow the child to experience a concept several ways:</P>

<ul>
  <li><img src="images/06elemmath.jpg" width="341" height="256" hspace="15" vspace="5" align="right">in visual form</li>
  <li>in tactile form</li>
</ul>

<p>The child works with the Montessori material to allow him or her to move 
towards the process of abstraction.  All mathematical concepts are presented in this 
way, for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reading numbers</li>
	<li>fractions</li>
	<li>squaring of binomials</li>
</ul>

<p>The Montessori child feels as though math is a puzzle to figure out and 
approaches Mathematics without hesitation.  The child is given the "keys" to unlock 
the mysteries of the mathematical world.</p>
