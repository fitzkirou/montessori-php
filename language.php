<P> Our language program begins with <B><I>enrichment of vocabulary</I></B>. For 
  example, it is not unusual for a child attending our school to understand such 
  words as: </P>

<UL>
  <LI><img src="images/06language1.jpg" width="256" height="341" hspace="30" vspace="10" align="right">&quot;curvilinear&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;parallelepiped&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;continent&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;obtuse&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;conjunction&quot;</LI>
</UL>

<P>Children love beautiful language, and we give them exact terms like
these to name their environment and convey their thoughts.</P>

<H2>Natural Learning with Language Materials</H2>

<P>Reading and writing come naturally to the children after they have worked
for some time with two special materials:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B><I>sandpaper letters</I></B> (which the children trace and sound
phonetically)</LI>

<LI>the <B><I>movable alphabet</I></B> (the formation of words by combining
phonetic sounds).</LI>
</UL>

<P>Further, the children work with materials to concretely learn the <B><I>function
of words</I></B>. Finally, Montessori students experiment with <B><I>reading
analysis</I></B>.</P>
