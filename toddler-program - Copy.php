  Toddler Program<br>
  (18 to 30 Months Old) </h1>

<P> Our toddler community provides an environment which is carefully prepared 
  to meet the unique needs of this age group. Our classroom accommodates children 
  18 to 30 Months Old with one teacher for every five students.</P>
  
<p> In this setting the children come to feel the classroom is their own peaceful, 
  special space where they play a meaningful role in their own care and the care 
  of their environment. All furniture is a size that allows maximum independence, 
  and the Montessori toddler materials are designed to be attractive and inviting 
  to the children. </p>  

<P>Taught by a certified Montessori toddler teacher, the program for the youngest group at GMS acknowledges that a child's mind is most absorbent during the first three years of life. Because of what Dr. Maria Montessori termed "the absorbent mind", children develop many language and motor skills without formal instruction, as long as their environment is rich with learning opportunities.</P>

  The primary goal of our toddler program is to create a nurturing and secure 
  environment where young children can do what they do best - explore everything!</P>
<P>The main focus is language and motor development, assisting the child in developing 
  self-help skills (including toilet-training), and helping children build trust 
  in relationships. </P>

<p>
  The entire toddler environment is designed to allow the children to explore 
  and to develop concentration and coordination. The teachers observe the children 
  each day and monitor their development and readiness.
</p>

<P>Social interaction, language skills, independence, food preparation, music and movement activities are integral to the Montessori toddler experience.</P>
